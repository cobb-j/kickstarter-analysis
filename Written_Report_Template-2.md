# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
    - The overview of this project can be defined as a deeper look into the functions of Excel and how we can use data and simpilfy it to better understand the complexity of the data we are provided. Also we can use excel to create visual aid to help better explain data in the most simpliest form and us the charts as a measurable.

## Analysis and Challenges
- Applying Filters, conditional formatting
- Create and filter pivot tables
- Creating box and whisker and line graphs
- V-lookup/H-lookups

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- Anaylsis showed simplifying data into a pivot table to show dates for plays on a monthly basis that shows successul, failed or canceled outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- Analysis shows a more detailed spreadsheet of data using CountIFs forumalas from previous sheets. Afterwards we use the data provided to create a visual aid for the data.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- The biggest challenge for me was getting the formulas correct to be able to get data from outh sheets in the excel file. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    - The 1st conclusion we can draw is that the pivot table simpifies the data to a monthly basis to show the flucutanting growth and decline over the year.
    - We wouldnt have been able to get the data if we did not create the pivot table to simplify the information.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    -The successful, failed, canceled outcomes were consistant with the the information pulled. The chart that was created shows that the plays were most successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    - The limitations we do not know are what are the outliers in the dataset that we are provided compared to the other parameters.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    - We could have used a pie chart for the outcones based on goals and for the outcomes based on lauch dates we can use scatter plot as well.
